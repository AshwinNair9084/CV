        <p>As an enthusiastic learner, I seek an entry-level position to begin my career in a high-level professional environment. I wish to work in a dynamic organization that will contribute to my professional and personal growth. My subject of
          interest
          is the Natural language processing and how it would eventually be able to help in the advancement of AI. I’ve always been keen to know why and how a particular process happens, whether it be in the field of Data science or Mathematics.
          I am looking forward to working for my dream, which will allow me to improve my skills, learn, and grow. Through all of my hard work and dedication, I’ll make sure that I turn out as an asset to this field. I promise to devote all my time
          and
          effort to the upliftment of this field.</p>
